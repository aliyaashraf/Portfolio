          <p>Hai! It's Aliya!</p>
          <p>
            I am a third year CS Btech student. A web developer enthusiast is
            what I like to call myself. Besides web development, my favourite
            fields of study are ethical hacking and machine learning. My latest
            obsession is cryptography. Being a beginner, I'm still finding ways
            and places to learn it from. If you guys have any recommendations,
            do let me know. Despite the difficulty in cracking them (I take a
            minimum of 2 days even for the easiest ones); but the immense
            pleasure after the decryption knows no bounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being an extrovert and a team player, I always enjoy working in
            groups. I believe that working or even learning as a group always
            brings out the best in people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even today, women in technology are very few. I would like to
            increase opportunities for women in this field, and ensure that they
            would always be given chances.
