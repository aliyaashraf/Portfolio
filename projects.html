      <div class="c">This is a simple tool used to change a phones sound profile. The application has been developed to solve 
        a crucial problem that everyone today faces- misplacing a phone when it is on vibration or silent mode. #codeADAM is the
        best solution when such an issue arises. This tool can change a missing phones sound profile through any other basic 
        phone- not necessarily a smart phone; by a simple message.
